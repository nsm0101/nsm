# CloseDose

CloseDose is a simple front-end prototype for a pediatric medication dosing calculator. It is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is hosted via GitHub Pages. The project uses a responsive layout and adapts to your device's preferred color scheme.

## Dark & Light Modes

The site supports both dark and light modes using the CSS prefers-color-scheme media query. Dark mode uses a dark teal background with a white logo, while light mode uses a teal background and dark logo. You can find the assets in the images/ directory. If you wish to swap in different colors or images, update the relevant variables in style.css.
